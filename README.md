# Gaia Commons Council Dashboard

**"One Vote, Forever Fed" -- 2026 Minnesota Ballot Initiative**

A full-stack analytics and management dashboard for Minnesota's statewide school greenhouse program, tracking pilot statistics, endowment data, funding sources, and strategic timeline events.

## What Is This?

The Gaia Commons Council is building a program to place 1,200 greenhouses at Minnesota schools with proper infrastructure and space, feeding 712,500 students year-round fresh produce. Funded by a $5 billion perpetual endowment generating $225 million per year, the program creates 2,400 permanent jobs and eliminates 5,200 metric tons of CO2 emissions annually from reduced food transportation.

## Key Features
